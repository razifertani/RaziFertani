Test Driven Development:
 - Improves code quality: TDD helps focus thinking about what needs to be done first.
 - Well-written tests serve as documentation: Developers read the tests to understand expected functionality.
 - Gives you more confidence when changing code: After a test has started passing you know quickly if refactoring has broken something when it starts failing.
 - Helps reproduce bugs: TDD helps resolve bugs. When a bug fix is needed, you first write a test that fails because of the bug. And when the test passes, you know it’s fixed.
